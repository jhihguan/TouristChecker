# TouristChecker

This is a nearby place searching application. I integrated with Yelp, Foursquare, and Google Place API. If you allow location service, it will provide information around you. You can also long press on map to get information around that point.

#####`Google Place` only show information near your location.

To run this application, you have to install [`Cocoapods`](https://cocoapods.org/) before. Than...

1. type `pod install` in terminal
2. open `TouristChecker.xcworkspace`
3. run!
